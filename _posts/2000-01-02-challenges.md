## Challenges in SAP Document Management

Managing documents in SAP environments is no small feat. The complexity and issues are multifold, affecting both operational efficiency and compliance.

### Costly Manual Processes

- **Time-Consuming**: Extracting documents one by one from SAP is a labor-intensive process.
- **Human Error**: Manual retrieval can lead to mistakes, affecting compliance and decision-making.

### Inefficient Document Retrieval

- **Scattered Data**: Documents are often stored across different systemsâ€”SAP database, SharePoint, OpenText, and more.
- **Lack of Automation**: No easy way to mass export or convert documents for different business needs.

### Limited Accessibility

- **User Restrictions**: Access to documents can be limited based on user roles, making it challenging for cross-departmental tasks.
- **Poor Searchability**: Finding the right document when you need it is often like looking for a needle in a haystack.

### Compliance Risks

- **Audit Traces**: Manually managed documents are hard to audit, posing a compliance risk.
- **Data Integrity**: Without proper version control and tracking, data integrity can be compromised.

Addressing these challenges requires a solution that's not just robust but also adaptable to specific business needs. That's where **SAP Document Stream** comes in.
